            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be
             distracted by the readable content of a page when looking 
             at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
              a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
               'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem 
                Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
                 uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                  evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                   (injected humour and the like).
